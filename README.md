Here is the README.md file for your Employee Management System:

# Employee Management System

This is an **Employee Management System** built using **ReactJS**. The application uses a **local database** based on the browser’s `localStorage` to store and retrieve data.

## Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Allows an admin to manage employees, assign tasks, and view employee details.
- **Employee Dashboard**: Employees can view their assigned tasks and manage them.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: The application stores data locally using `localStorage`, and this data persists across page reloads.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**  
    Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/employee-management-system
   cd employee-management-system
   npm install
   LocalStorage Setup
   Before running the application, ensure that localStorage is initialized with data. In the App.jsx file, there is a commented-out section for initializing localStorage. Uncomment the following lines in App.jsx:
   ```

js
Copy code
// localStorage.clear();
// setLocalStorage();
This will populate the localStorage with initial data (such as user credentials and tasks) when you first run the app.

Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed and localStorage is set up, start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Credentials
The system has the following initial credentials:

Admin Credentials:
Email: admin@me.com
Password: 123
Employee Credentials:
The system includes 5 employees, each with the following credentials:

Email: e1@e.com, Password: 123
Email: e2@e.com, Password: 123
Email: e3@e.com, Password: 123
Email: e4@e.com, Password: 123
Email: e5@e.com, Password: 123
